The structure of the folder, naming following scene number and paragraph number.

*Note: A paragraph contains tons of scenes, and a scenes contains tons of parts

The naming files follows this structure: <file type>-<paragraph number>-<scene num>-<part>

	ppt-01-03-01.pptx 

	   or the documemtary videos, in scene 02, paragraph (in the #script folder) 04, part 02, has
this name: vid-02-04-02.mp4

#Special: 
	+ If the file is the background element, the paragraph number = bg
	+ For the video background, the full name is bg+<part>
